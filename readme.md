> 1. What is Node.js?    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine from Google Chrome to execute code outside of the browser. Node.js provides a rich set of libraries and modules, making it ideal for building scalable and real-time applications.
